   Hi, I'm 33 years old BBA, Information Technology student from Hamk. My main job is at Valio, but next three years I'm going to be a student.
   <br> <br>
   First time I got interested of coding was when I transfered to Valio's new factory in 2017. I participated to a project where we started a new packingline.
   I was always thought that you have to be a super smart to be able to code. When I saw the developers on action, I slowly realized that I kind of understand what they are doing.
   I have always been very interested of learning new things and I realized that it-field is perfect that way. You have always new things to learn.
   <br>
   <br>
 
I started coding in summer 2019, with C++. I learned the basics from great a Youtube-video. 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLnPwxZdW4Y&list=LLa7TwVlHiWP4emxvzyJoD6A&index=52&t=314s" target="_blanck"> (You can watch the video at this link) </a> 
<br>
After I started my studies in Hamk I have also learned C#. At the moment we are learning HTML and PHP.
Besides programming languages, I have learned more about Word, Powerpoint and Excel. I have also got familiar with meeting-tools like Zoom and Teams.
During my long career at Valio, I have learned to get along with different people. At school I have had opportunity to improve my people skills in different kind of projects.
<br>
<br>
As an employee I'm self-imposed, helpful, kind, flexible and I have high work ethic. Sometimes I have a bad habit to make my own rules, 
but sometimes my rules are harder than others. 

<br>
<br>
Along with school and work, special things in my life are my husband, family, friends and our cat Monni.
At my spare time, I like to do yoga, swim, play discgolf and go for a walk. 
As you may noticed in the front page, I like to be upside down and goof off.
