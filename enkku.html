            Hi, I'm 35 years old third year BBA, Information Technology student from Hamk. 
            <br>
            I have just came from exchange at Escuela Técnica Superior de ingeniería y diseño industrial in Madrid, Spain. Currently I am doing ICT-project at school and after that I have my internship, before finishing the school. Before school I worked 16 years at Valio as a packer. 
            <br> <br>
            First time I got interested of coding was when I transfered to Valio's new factory in 2017. I participated to a project where we started a new packingline.
            I was always thought that you have to be a super smart to be able to code. When I saw the developers in action, I slowly realized that I kind of understand what they are doing.
            I have always been very interested of learning new things and I realized that it-field is perfect that way. You have always new things to learn.
            <br>
            <br>
            
            I started coding in summer 2019, with C++. I learned the basics from a great Youtube-video. 
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLnPwxZdW4Y&list=LLa7TwVlHiWP4emxvzyJoD6A&index=52&t=314s" target="_blanck" style="color: black;"> (Follow this link to watch the video) </a> 
            <br>
            After I started my studies in Hamk I have also learned for example C#, Java, Python and how to use Robot framework.
            Besides programming languages, I have learned more about Word, Powerpoint and Excel. I have also got familiar with meeting-tools like Zoom and Teams.
            During my long career at Valio, I have learned to get along with different kind of people. At school I have had opportunity to improve my people skills in different kind of projects.
            <br>
            <br>
            As an employee I'm self-imposed, helpful, kind, flexible and I have high work ethic. I like honesty, but I believe that you can be honest and kind at the same time. I believe in equality and I don't like to work with people who think that they are better than others. 

            <br>
            <br>
            Along with school and work, special things in my life are my husband, family, friends and our three gerbils Diva, Ama and Ara.
            At my spare time, I like to do yoga, practice Krav maga, swim, play discgolf and go for a walk. 
            As you may noticed in the front page, I like to be upside down and goof off.  
            <br>
